# Propnet
Propnet was originally written by Zachary Patridge as part of his
[thesis](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~mit/Papers/PRICAI22.pdf).
See original code [here](https://github.com/Zac-OS/deep-hi-ggp).

To build the propnet (which is required to both train/play), simply run `bash build.sh`
from within `/propnet`. Note that any changes to files within `/propnet` will not be
be implemented without a rebuild.
